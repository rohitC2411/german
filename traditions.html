    <h2>What are their Traditions?</h2>
    <p>Modern German customs include "Kaffee und Kuchen," which is the equivalent of an English afternoon tea and involves families and friends stopping what they are doing to gather for coffee and cake in the afternoon. Another important event is the yearly Munich Beer Festival, popularly known as Oktoberfest worldwide.<br><br>
Germans are stoic individuals who pursue precision and perfectionism in all facets of their lives. Even in jest, they refuse to acknowledge their mistakes, and they hardly ever provide praise. Although they may at first appear unpleasant, they have a strong sense of community, a social conscience, and a desire to fit in.<br><br>In Germany, Christianity predominates, with Islam constituting the largest minority faith. However, there are a few other religions that collectively make up the religions of about 3-4% of the populace. Judaism is one of the additional religions practised in Germany.</p>
